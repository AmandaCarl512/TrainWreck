# TrainWreck

This is an app designed to let the user add a train to a database that will update the expected schedule of said train in real time.

Uses Firebase, a Google owned server that houses databases for apps - to store the train information, and then show the information updating to the user for each train added.

Bonus (Extra Challenges)
Consider updating your "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).

Try adding update and remove buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.
